# Copper-Industry-Sales-Prediction-Lead-Classification
•	Developed an end-to-end machine learning solution for the copper industry to predict product selling prices (regression) and classify sales leads as WON/LOST (classification).
•	 The project involved extensive data preprocessing (outlier treatment, skewness handling, feature engineering), model training using ExtraTrees and RandomForest algorithms, and deployment via a Streamlit web app. 
•	Enabled real-time user input, dynamic predictions, and insights through an interactive GUI with integrated scaling and model loading using joblib.
•	Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pickle
